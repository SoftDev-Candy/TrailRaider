# TrailRaider

Download: GitHub is currently not allowing me to store the project, but you can download the complete game from this Google Drive link(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIqeRcSeOzijAOjTD1hwSQs04RonJkPP/view?usp=drive_link). 
I'll continue working on resolving the GitHub issue.





TrailRaider is a game development project created to enhance my skills in game programming and level design. The project features:

Lighting: Implemented using Lumen for dynamic and realistic lighting effects.

Custom Puzzles: Designed with unique mechanics to offer challenging gameplay.

Gameplay Mechanics: Developed to complement the puzzle-solving experience, adding depth and variety.

Player Movement: Implemented smooth and responsive player controls.

Programming Concepts: Gained hands-on experience with constructors, classes, and other fundamental programming concepts.

Ongoing Development: I am currently working on adding new levels to expand the game.


This project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to dive deeper into game development and improve my technical skills.
